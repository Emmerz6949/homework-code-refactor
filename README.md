# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

This repository was created to refactor the pre-existing code of the Horiseon website. You can use the commits to follow my journey of turning their hot mess into something worth deploying.



### How did I do it?

I used semantic html tags, html comments, and spruced up the CSS.

If you wish to visit the Horiseon website you can do so by following this link: https://emmerz6949.github.io/horiseon-code-refactor .



### Installation and Usage

There isn't anything to install or use as this is just a website that has been refractored and deployed.



### Credits

The original Horiseon website files we're provided by Trilogy Education Services (https://www.trilogyed.com/).
